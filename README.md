Apply a standardized set of labels to github repositories

# Labels styleguide

All repositories are likely to have some assortment of unique labels. Many / Most of these should have color black (#000000), which is the color we use for feature areas.

Labels should be lower case.

# Setup

```
$ brew install lastpass-cli
```

# Run instructions

To allow this tool to fetch the github token from lastpass, you have to log in
to lastpass each time you want to use it.

```
$ lpass login <email@email.com>
```

To apply all the labels from labels.json to a repository, do, e.g.:

```
$ bin/labeler apply_labels pulibrary/figgy,pulibrary/dpul,pulibrary/pulmap,pulibrary/pulfalight,pulibrary/lae-blacklight
```

To delete a label from all of the RDSS repositories, do:

```
$ bin/labeler delete_label pulibrary/pdc_discovery,pulibrary/pdc_describe,pulibrary/tiger-data-app,pulibrary/oawaiver,pulibrary/rdss-handbook [label]
```
